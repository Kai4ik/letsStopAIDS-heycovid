## Data

The previous year website was fetching data from HyGraphCMS.
This version has hard-coded data available in JSON format.
File can be found in the **_src/data_** directory.
It has the following format:

- **data** - list/array of objects/dictionaries where each object/dict has the following properties:
  - **_languageLabel_** - string - what user sees on the screen, a 2-letter ISO code with a full language name in parenthesis
    - **_languageValue_** - string - a 2-letter ISO code used as query parameter in URL. Should match to the ISO code specified in languageLabel
    - **_bannerText_** - string - was not translated and thus always will be in English
    - **_cards_** - list/array of objects/dictionaries where each object/dict has the following properties:
      - **_cardId_** - string - id of the card used as a query parameter in the URL. Continues indexing from the 2020 and 2021 versions (because of that for some languages it does not start from 0)
    - **_name_** - string - author name
    - **_location_** - string - location of the author
    - **_title_** - string that contains emoji characters that are replaced by custom emojis- main title that users see in the bubble message
    - **_text_** - string - subtitle that users see under the bubble message
    - **_fact_** - string that contains emoji characters that are replaced by custom emojis - fact that users see when modal window is open
    - **_link_** - string - absolute URL

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```

/

â”œâ”€â”€ public/

â”‚ â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg

â”œâ”€â”€ src/

â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ components/

â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Card.astro

â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/

â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro

â”‚ â””â”€â”€ pages/

â”‚ â””â”€â”€ index.astro

â””â”€â”€ package.json

```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.
Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
